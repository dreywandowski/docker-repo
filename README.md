## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Docker Repo
This is just an empty repository I've created to help me dockerize Laravel applications fast and without stress.
Essential services like Apache and cron service have already being activated so its pretty much plug and play.

Steps to run below:
1. Clone to you machine
2. Run composer update and composer install
3. set php artisan key:generate
4. Copy your .env details from .env to .env.example (or any name of your choice, just make sure to update it in the Dockerfile)
5. Build with : docker build -t laravel-app .
6. Run with docker run -p 8000:80 laravel-app
6. Check running containers: docker ps
7. Stop container: docker stop container_id_or_name
8. Check logs with docker logs <container_id_or_name>
9. Enter the container linux shell: docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash
